### This script was made so I can put it in some kind of bar, and it would display that if my luksVault is mounted or not
### The script works by checking if there is a file availble or not, this file called CHECK is just an empty file that is
### only used for this purpose, if it's not available display nothing in order to make the bar look more clean


### In order for the virtual-machine watcher to work, we need to allow `virsh domstate [vm_name] to be run without sudo password`
### this can be achieved by modifying the sudoers file

### The need for them to run in async isn't necessary, it's just a bit faster since the virsh command takes a bit more time than the file checking

### TODO: Set up MEGA cloud with gocryptfs and also make a watcher for that ❌
